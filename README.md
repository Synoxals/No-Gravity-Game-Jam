This game uses a unique movement system in which you move in the opposite direction to the direction that you attack in.
There are 2 different enemy types, one being a ranged enemy and one being a physical enemy.
You move by pressing the WASD keys to go in that direction while attack in the reverse, and there is a special shockwave ability that you are able to utilise by pressing V

In order to win you must achieve 30 kills without being hit once.
